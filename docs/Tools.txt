#Tools overview

FITS is configured to use a set of 8 tools for identifying, validating, and extracting technical metadata.

=Jhove=

Identifies, extracts technical metadata, and validates files.
Jhove is written in Java. The FITS tool wrapper uses the Java API.  The Jhove xml output is converted to FITS XML using XSLT.
xml/jhove/jhove_xslt_map.xml is used to specify which xslt to apply for the given identified format.
Formats supported: jpg,tiff,jp2,gif,wave,aiff,xml,html,ascii,utf-8,pdf.

=Exiftool=

Idetifies and extracts technical metadata.
Exiftool is written in Perl.  A windows executable is also available.  The Exiftool tool wrapper detects the operating system type
and calls the appropriate version of the tool.  The tab delimited output is captured, converted to a simple XML stucture, then 
converted to FITS XML using xslt.  xml/exiftool/exiftool_xslt_map.xml is used to specify which xslt to apply for the given identified format.
Formats supported: jpg,tiff,jp2,gif,bmp,png,psd,dng,wav,mp3,mp4,m4a,aiff,rm,ogg,flac,xml,html,pdf,doc.

=National Library of New Zealand Metadata Extractor (NLNZ)=

Idetifies and extracts technical metadata.
The FITS NLNZ tool wrapper uses the provided Java API. The NLNZ native XML output is coverted to FITS XML using XSLT.
xml/nlnz/fits/nlnz_xslt_map.xml is used to specify which xslt to apply to the given identified format.
Formats supported: jpg,tiff,gif,bmp,wav,mp3,xml,html,pdf,doc,wordperfect,msworks,openoffice

=File Utility=

Identifies files.
File Utility is usually bundled with Linux, Unix and OS X.  The GnuWin32 port is provided for use on Windows.
Due to variations in versions this may cause different output when run on different platforms.  
File Utility is called in its default mode (no arguements), and also with -i to get the mime type.
The output is converted into a simple XML document, and then converted to FITS XML using xml/fileutility/fileutility_to_fits.xslt.

=Droid=

Identifies files.
Droid is written in Java. The fits tool wrapper uses the API. 
The output is converted into a simple XML document, and then converted to FITS XML using xml/droid/droid_to_fits.xslt.
The Droid configuration file, and signature file is located in tools/droid.

=FFIdent=

Identifies files.
FFIdent is written in Java.  The FITS tool wrapper uses the API.
The output is coverted into a simple xml document, and then converted to FITS XML using xml/ffident/ffident_to_fits.xslt.
The ffident format configuration file is in tools/ffident/formats.txt

=FileInfo=

Extracts technical metadata.
FileInfo creates FITS XML natively.  It determines basic file information like file name, size, file system last modified date, and md5 checksums.
It uses the fast md5 jar from http://www.twmacinta.com/myjava/fast_md5.php.

=XmlMetadata=

Idetifies and extracts technical metadata.
XmlMetadata creates FITS XML natively.  Its sole purpose is to identify XML and parse out the default namespace and schema location for the
FITS text metadata section.
