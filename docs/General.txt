#summary Introduction to FITS

= Introduction =

The File Information Tool Set (FITS) identifies, validates and extracts technical metadata for a wide range of file formats.  It acts as a wrapper, invoking and managing the output from several other open source projects and tools. The output from these tools are converted into a common format, compared and consolidated into a single XML output file.  FITS is written in Java and is compatible with Java 1.5 or higher.  The tools currently used are:
  * [http://hul.harvard.edu/jhove/ Jhove]
  * [http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ Exiftool]
  * [http://meta-extractor.sourceforge.net/ National Library of New Zealand Metadata Extractor]
  * [http://droid.sourceforge.net/ DROID]
  * [http://schmidt.devlib.org/ffident/index.html FFIdent]
  * [http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?file File Utility] ([http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ windows])

=How to Use FITS=

FITS can be used as a command line tool or within other projects using its API.  It relies on an environment variable named FITS_HOME to find the needed configuration and xsl transforms directories.

==Command Line==

Windows .bat file and Linux/OS X shell launcher scripts are provided.  These scripts build the necessary Java classpath and set the FITS_HOME environment variable automatically.

==Command Line Options==
 * -i The input file you want to examine
 * -o The destination fo the output XML file.
 * -h Prints the usage message
 * -v Displays the FITS version number

If -o is not specified then the output is sent to the console window.

The general syntax is:

`>fits.[bat|sh] -i input_file -o output_file`

== API ==

When using the API the FITS_HOME environment variable must be passed in with the Fits() constructor.
See the Developer Info section.

=Overview of FITS Life Cycle=

1) configuration loaded
	Tool wrappers created

2) for each available tool:
	each tool executed on file and creates a ToolOutput object containing a fits xml document
	If necessary, XSLT is applied to tool output to create the FITS compatible xml
	mapping applied (xml/fits_xml_map.xml)

3) consolidation
	Identities consolidated, format tree (xml/fits_format_tree.xml) consulted
	Output from tools unable to identify the file, or those who identified a less specific type are thrown out
	Fileinfo sections merged
	Filestatus sections merged
	metadata sections merged

4) Output
	The consolidated fits xml file is written to a file or the console
	If using the API a FitsOutput object is returned

=Output Format=

Each tool wrapper must implement the Tool interface and return a ToolOutput object.  ToolOutput must contain a valid fits xml JDOM object.
Each tool's output is validated against the local FITS xml schema when the ToolOutput object is created.  The schema is located in xml/fits_output.xsd

During consolidation tool output conflicts are accounted for by adding a status attribute to the element. 

After consolidation a single fits xml file will reference the online schema located at http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/xml/xsd/fits/fits_output.xsd

== Tool Output Consolidation Notes ==

If multiple tools disagree on an identity or other metadata value a status attribute is added to the element with a value of "CONFLICT".
If only a single tool reports an identity or other metadata value a status attribute is added to the element with a value of "SINGLE_RESULT"
If multiple tools agree on a an identity or value the status attribute is omitted.

The ordering preference of the tools in xml/fits.xml determines the ordering of the conflicting values.  If the report-conflict configuration
option is false then only the tool that first reported the element is displayed.  The other conflicting values are discarded.

All tools that agree on an identity are consolidated into a single <identity> section.
Technical metadata is only output (and a part of the consolidation process) for tools that were able to identify the file and that are listed 
in the first <identity> section. All other output is discarded.
